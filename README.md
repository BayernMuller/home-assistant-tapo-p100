# Home Assistant Tapo Integration
This is a custom integration to control Tapo devices from home assistant.

The core of the integration is provied by [plugp100](https://github.com/petretiandrea/plugp100) python library based on work of [@K4CZP3R](https://github.com/K4CZP3R/tapo-p100-python).

## Next improvements (TODO)
- [ ] add support for tapo light bulb
- [x] allow configuration from home assistant UI with config flow
- [ ] improve it using pure async home assistant's method

## How to install into home assistant
1. clone this repository and copy the ```tapo``` folder inside the ```custom_compontens``` folder of home assistant
2. add device from integrations
